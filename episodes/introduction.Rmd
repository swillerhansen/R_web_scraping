## Introduction
This is a course in how to use the programming language R to do web scraping. Web scraping is a set of methods to systematically download parts of web pages by writing code in a script instead of copy-pasting from the web page.

A web pages is made up of elements in the HTML language. 
HTML is a hierarchical file format
Insert example of HTML hierarchy here

The advantage with using web scraping is that we can in our script specify which specific parts of the web page that we want to download by referring to those elements' HTML code. This allows for precision in what we download.

Furthermore, as we will do in this course, we can scrape the same element on multiple pages. i.e. instead of opening each page separately and for each page marking the parts of the page that we want to download and copy-pasting it, we can write a script that will scrape the same HTML element on multiple pages. This allows for speed and consistency
